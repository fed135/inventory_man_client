# Inventory management client 

## Overview

This is a very basic inventory management interface built from https://github.com/infernojs/inferno-boilerplate

I'm doing this project for 2 reasons:

1- Provide a customizable and lightweight tool for my wife to manage her Tupperware inventory
2- A chance for me to learn React/Inferno

## Running the client

`npm start`. 

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Requirements

Required NodeJS v6+
